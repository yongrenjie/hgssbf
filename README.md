# hgssbf
Damage calculator for the Battle Factory in Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver.

This is work that I did way back in 2013, when HGSS was still somewhat popular. It's not amazingly well-written code, but it works, and has options for pretty much every scenario that you could ever come across in the Factory.

To use: clone the entire repository, then open hgssbf.html in a browser of your choice.
